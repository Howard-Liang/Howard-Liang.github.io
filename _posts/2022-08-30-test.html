	If I am to encapsulate my adventure at National Taiwan University with one single word, 
	I will choose unexpected. My life and experiences have changed drastically from what I pictured myself to be today four years ago.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Throughout my college life, I have encountered countless challenges and adversities. 
	During those difficult times, some of my plans worked out perfectly, and some of my wishes came true. 
	Nonetheless, mostly, I found myself not accomplishing what I set out to achieve. 
	The most important lesson I learned is that life is unforeseeable, and disappointments are often inevitable. 
	No matter how diligently you work and how yearningly you want to reach your goal, sometimes you must accept your failures. 
	But do not get me wrong, I am still harsh and expect highly of myself. 
	What I am trying to convey is that I gradually comprehended that the appropriate way of taking the frustrations is to have 
	the courage to acknowledge and contemplate the reasons behind the defeats and adjust yourself for upcoming obstacles in life.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	There were times that the situations were so hard that I did not believe in myself for persevering through them. 
	I am glad that my friends and family were around me and supported me unconditionally during the worst and most depressing times in my life. 
	At NTU, I met friends that consistently challenged me to be the best version of myself, kept me grounded when I felt my world was falling apart, 
	and instilled self-confidence in me. I had never realized before my university life that friends could have such a profound and incredible impact on me. 
	Besides the friends of similar age, I am grateful for all the professors that taught or instructed me. 
	I learned from them not only the course materials but also, surprisingly, their perspective on various subjects in life,
	as well as inspiring lifelong concepts.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Job's not finished, and I am only about to start my career. 
	Despite my supposition that the impediments in the future will only be more severe, I believe that I am well prepared for them, 
	thanks to my astonishing journey at NTU, during which the wonderful people I met and the exceptional experiences I had. 
	I will miss the NTU library study room, seat number B049. I will miss the time I spent hanging out with my friends after class. 
	I will miss the lake by which we chat, my beloved one. Happy Graduation.
